# Road quality analysis with Machine learning approach

*Brief overview:*

#### Background - problem
- **Vibrations in road vehicles cause several harmful effects**, health problems can occur for the passengers, and mechanical damage can occur to the vehicle components. Given the health, safety, and financial issues that arise, keeping the road network in good condition and detecting road defects as early as possible requires an extensive monitoring system.

#### Project objective
- Related to this, **our study presents the development of hardware and software** for a low-cost, multi-sensor **road quality monitoring system** for passenger vehicles. The developed monitoring system can classify road sections according to their quality parameters into four classes. In order to detect vibrations in the vehicle, accelerometers and gyroscope sensors are installed at several points.

#### Results



#### Project status
- The classification model is still in development phase, furthermore, the publication of additional algorithms (like map-matching and map-display solutions) can be expected in the near future too.
